well, if I ever get off my lazy butt it would be nice to have:
 ✅ a running log file so we know why it keeps crashing
 - ability to strip roles in bulk at the end of each semester (force people back to welcome screen)
 - mass delete: "clear last 100 comments"
 - role menu system like #choose-your-roles but supporting more roles than YAGPDB can.
 - put channels into "exam mode" (lock commenting to only mods for that course, all general chats, and any relevant 'coding languages' channels until an "all-clear" is given
 - force ppl to #choose-your-roles after #welcome but before seeing other chat channel's
 - automatic updating for #⛔-homework-⛔ based on chatbot style stuff (DM or public messages)

 - aliases for identity/identify


Documentation needs:

 - Architecture
 - How aliases work in the code
